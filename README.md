 GAME ENGINES 4 - Final Game Jam - 10 seconds

# Instructions
Controls:
WASD: 	Movement
SPACEBAR: 	Jump
LEFT SHIFT (hold): 	Sprint
LEFT MOUSE BUTTON: 	Fire Projectile
E: 	Activate Time Manipulation

You have 10 seconds to take out at least 20 bots.

Timer only starts when Emily destroys the first bot. Press LMB to fire her projectiles.

Destroy 5 bots to trigger the time manipulation ability. Press ‘E’ when its charged. Refer to the UI at the bottom of the screen to see its progress.

In manipulated time, Emily will slow down everything except herself (Timer, Enemies & her own projectile attacks). You will see her timer running out as soon as she triggers this ability.

Use the manipulated time for directing the projectiles to destroy the enemies when normal time flow is continued. Any enemy destroyed in manipulated time flow won't contribute to charge Emily’s ability.

Gameplay Strategies:
-	The best way to get good results is to wait for few seconds till enough bots spawn and spam her blast ability
-	As soon as she gets her Time Manipulation ability charged, activate it IMMEDIATELY
-	Before starting to attack on the slowed bots, take a good distance, aim at the bots where the projectile will land only after the Time Manipulation is finished and fire the projectiles and keep them ready
-	Following a good strategy is important to get a count of bots take down.
